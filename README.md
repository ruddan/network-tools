# Network Tools

Tools to make your administration of network devices easier. Also a playground for me to improve my python skills :)
As of now scripts only works with cisco devices.

## cisco_get_mac.py

Find mac-address in mac-address table, script takes input file which contains one or more devices.

## cisco_port_status.py

Search for interfaces with status connected, notconnect or err-disable, script takes input file which contains one or more devices.
